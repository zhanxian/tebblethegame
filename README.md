# tebblethegame


This is our React Native game for Computer Science 333 for Princeton University.  Please feel free to take a look at our work!


We consulted a Tetris game when building this project, and borrow heavily from its structure and approach.  That game can be found here: https://github.com/ggomaeng/react-native-tetris/blob/master/src/components/helpers.js

Many thanks, Sung Woo Park!
